Clustering

often, a set of data can be organized into a set of clusters. For example, you may be able to organize data into dusters that correspond to certain underlying properties(such demographic proteies including agem sex, geography, employement status, and so on) or certaing underlying processes(such as browsing, shopping, bot interactios, and other such begaviors on a website) the machine learning techniques to detect and lable these clusters are referred to as clustering tecnhiques, naturally.


Up to this point, the machine learning algorithms that we have exploted have been supervised. That is, we have a set of features or attributes paired with a correspongi label or number taht we are trying to predict. We user this labeled data to fir our model to the behavior that we already kenew about prior to trainning the model.


Most clustering techiques are unsupervised. As opposed to supervised tecniques for regression and classification, we often do not know about the clusters in our dataset prior to finding them with a clustering model. Thus we go into a clustering problem with a unlabeled dataset and an algrotihm, and we generate the cluster lables for our dat ausing clustering algorithm.

Further, clustering techniques are distinguisged from other machine learning techniques in that it is
rather difficult to say waht the correct or accurate clusters for tyhe given dataset are.
Depending on how many clusters you are looking for and the meausres that you are using for similiarity between data points, you might end up with a variety of sets of clustes, eacg having some underlying meaning. This does not mean that clustering techniques cannot be evaluated or validated, but it does mean that we neen to understand out limitations and be carefukl when quantifying our results.
